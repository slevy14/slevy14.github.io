I made this for a graphic design class in 2018 and have been using it since! It's taken a few different forms -- here's a look at how it's changed!<br>

Inspired by similar pieces I had seen, I created this much more detailed piece for a high school art show.<br>

For the logo project, I simplified this concept to create the original version of my personal logo.<br>

This version was used to create stickers that I put on everything (pictured here on water bottles).<br>

I used a modified version of this logo for a branding project, where I designed a logo and packaging for a fake brand of sunflower seeds.

When designing this website, I felt like it was time for an update: new color scheme, thicker lines, and a couple of other small changes. And here we are today!<br>
