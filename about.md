## Hello!

As I'm sure you could guess from the sidebar, name of the website, and landing page, my name is **Sammy** (actually it's Samuel, but I go by Sammy or Sam). I'm a **computer science** major at Occidental College, and I'm especially interested in the wonderful world of **game design**. Here are some other random things about me:
* I can solve a Rubik's cube in under 40 seconds
* I've been doing improv for almost 10 years
* I enjoy designing logos and graphics in Photoshop
* I've rewatched Parks & Rec too many times
